# Connect_Four

This is my implementation of a [project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/202) from the [JetBrainAcademy](https://hyperskill.org/tracks) platform. And my first project on Kotlin.

### About
Connect Four is a fun game for two players. The players place discs on a vertical board that is 7 columns wide and 6 rows tall. The goal of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. In this project, you will develop this game with a number of improvements.
